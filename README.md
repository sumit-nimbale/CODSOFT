🧠 CodSoft Machine Learning Internship Projects (Python, scikit-learn, NLP)

This repository contains three end-to-end Machine Learning projects completed as part of the CodSoft Machine Learning Internship (December Batch).

The projects focus on classical machine learning, NLP-based classification, imbalanced data handling, and correct evaluation metrics using Python and scikit-learn.

This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and ML fundamentals, not production deployment.

⚖️ Case Study: Imbalanced Data in Fraud Detection

Fraud detection datasets are extremely imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions forming a very small percentage of the data.

📊 Class Distribution
<p align="center"> <img src="class_distribution.png" width="600"> </p>

Due to this imbalance, accuracy is not a reliable metric.
The models are evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

This repository intentionally focuses on classical, interpretable ML models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest (where applicable)

Deep learning models are excluded to emphasize ML fundamentals.

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

All models are evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Metrics are chosen based on problem type and data distribution.
