# CODSOFT – Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship (December Batch)**.

The focus of these projects is to build **end-to-end ML pipelines**, emphasizing:
- Problem formulation
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Evaluation and interpretation

All projects are implemented using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

## 🎯 Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**Objective:**  
Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.


**Key Concepts Applied:**
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Supervised classification
- Model evaluation using multiple metrics


**Models Used:**
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression (comparison)


**Skills Demonstrated:**
- NLP pipeline design
- Feature extraction from unstructured text
- Model selection based on problem constraints
- Interpretation of classification results


## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I focused on:
- Understanding **why** a model is chosen, not just **how**
- Treating ML as a decision-making system
- Building reproducible and interpretable solutions
- Applying theoretical concepts to practical problems
  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis)
 

## 📌 Notes
- This repository is intended for **learning and demonstration purposes**
- Each task README contains task-specific details
- Emphasis is placed on clarity, structure, and reasoning
