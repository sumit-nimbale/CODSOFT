## CodSoft Machine Learning Internship Projects         

-This repository contains three machine learning projects completed as part of the CodSoft Machine Learning Internship    (December Batch).

-The projects focus on classical machine learning fundamentals, correct problem formulation, and appropriate evaluation   metrics using Python and scikit-learn.

-The objective is learning and clarity of implementation rather than production deployment.

---

## Repository Overview
-Three independent machine learning tasks
-Text and binary classification problems
-Emphasis on data preprocessing and evaluation
-Handling of imbalanced datasets
-Clean, reproducible project structure

---

## Tasks Included
-Task 1 — Movie Genre Classification
  -Text classification using movie descriptions
  -Feature extraction with TF-IDF
  -Multi-class model evaluation
  -Folder: Task 1 - Movie Genre Classification/

-Task 2 — Credit Card Fraud Detection
  -Binary classification on highly imbalanced data
  -Focus on precision, recall, and false negatives
  -Evaluation beyond accuracy
  -Folder: Task_2_Credit_card_fraud_detection/

-Task 3 — SMS Spam Detection
  -Binary text classification
  -NLP preprocessing and TF-IDF
  -Model comparison and selection
  -Folder: Task_3_SMS_Spam_Detection/

## Models Used
-Logistic Regression
-Naive Baye
-Decision Trees
-Support Vector Machine
-Random Forest (where applicable)

---

## Evaluation Metrics
-Confusion Matrix
-Precision
-Recall
-F1-Score
Metrics are selected based on problem characteristics, especially for imbalanced datasets.
