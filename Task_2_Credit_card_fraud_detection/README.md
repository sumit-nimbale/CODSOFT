## 🎬 Project Overview

![Application Interface](./assets/app_interface.png)

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict the **genre of a movie** based solely on its **text description/plot**. The objective is to demonstrate how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques can convert raw text into numerical features and use them for supervised classification.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Given a movie plot as input text, automatically classify it into the most appropriate **movie genre**.

This is a **text classification** problem where the input is unstructured text and the output is a categorical label.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* The dataset consists of **movie plot summaries** and their corresponding **genres**.
* Each sample contains:

  * `text` → Movie description / plot
  * `label` → Movie genre

**Dataset Source:** (external link provided in repository)

---

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology

The project follows a standard NLP-based machine learning pipeline:

1. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing text
   * Removing punctuation and special characters
   * Cleaning unnecessary symbols

2. **Feature Extraction**

   * **TF-IDF Vectorization** is used to convert text into numerical feature vectors.
   * This captures the importance of words relative to the dataset.

3. **Model Selection**

   * **Multinomial Naive Bayes** is used for classification.
   * Chosen due to its effectiveness and efficiency for text-based problems.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Data is split into training and testing sets.
   * Model performance is evaluated using:

     * Accuracy
     * F1-score

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** – Feature extraction
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes** – Classification algorithm
